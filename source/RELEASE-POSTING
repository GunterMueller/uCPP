(*ANNOUNCEMENT*.

Version 7.0.0 of uC++ (pronounced micro-C++) is an extended C++ providing
light-weight concurrency on uniprocessor and multiprocessor computers running
the UNIX operating system.  uC++ extends C++ in somewhat the same way that C++
extends C.  The extensions introduce new objects that augment the existing
control flow facilities and provide concurrency.  uC++ provides both direct and
indirect communication using the traditional routine call mechanism.  All
aspects of uC++ are statically type-checked.  Furthermore, uC++ provides
mechanisms for precisely controlling the order in which requests are serviced
and for postponing work on already-accepted requests.


*NEW FEATURES*

0. fixed a number of bugs and removed warnings
1. add uMutexLock and update uCondLock to support uMutexLock
2. updates and cleanup of python gdb commands for uC++
3. task forwards unhandled exception to joiner task via UnhandledException
4. add allocation routines aalloc, resize, amemalign; add realloc with alignment
5. abort when out of memory, return 0p for zero size allocation request
6. add call to defaultTerminate() before forwarding UnhandledException
7. replace malloc_dimension with malloc_size
8. add coroutine actor
9. add actor promise, promise message, and trace messages
10. add _ResumeTop for algebraic effects with bidirectional resumption control-flow
11. support g++-10
12. turn on build STATISTICS
13. replace uThisProcessor().getClock().getTime() with uClock::currTime()

*REQUIREMENTS*

uC++ requires at least:

  * g++-6 or greater. uC++ does NOT compile using other compilers or operating
    systems.

  * gmake-3.79.1 or greater, which is available by anonymous ftp from any FSF
    mirror site.


*FTP SITE*

Version 7.0.0 of uC++ can be obtained by one of:

  $ git clone https://github.com/pabuhr/uCPP.git
  $ wget http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~usystem/pub/uSystem/u++-7.0.0.sh

See the README file for instructions on building and installing.


*PORTABILITY*

uC++ comes configured to run on the following platforms (single and multiple
processor):

	linux-x86_32 : Linux 4.x.x or greater, AMD/Intel 32-bit
	linux-x86_64 : Linux 4.x.x or greater, AMD/Intel 64-bit
